# programming-languages

This repository contains all challenges I have completed to learn new programming languages. These challenges may include:
- 📘 Tutorials
- 👨‍💻 Code-alongs
- 🧩 Guided and unguided projects

> ⚠️ **Note**: As of May 23, 2025, this repository focuses primarily on languages I am **actively learning**. Languages I am already proficient in (e.g., Python) may not yet be reflected here.

## 📂 Repository Structure
All tutorial-based code is appropriately attributed to its original authors where applicable. Some files may be modified or re-typed as part of my learning process.
Each folder in the root directory corresponds to a specific programming language. Inside each language folder, you'll find:

- A `README.md` explaining my progress and goals with that language.
- Code exercises, projects, or notes organized by topic or tutorial source.
